## Sample initialization file for GNU nano
## Please note that you must have configured nano with --enable-nanorc
## for this file to be read!  Also note that characters specially
## interpreted by the shell should not be escaped here.
##
## To make sure a value is not enabled, use "unset <option>"
##
## For the options that take parameters, the default value is given.
## Other options are unset by default.

## Use auto-indentation
 set autoindent

## Backup files to filename~
 set backup

## Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.
# set const

## Use cut to end of line with ^K by default
# set cut

## Set the line length for wrapping text and justifying paragraphs.
## If fill is negative, the line length will be the screen width less
## this number.
##
# set fill -8

## Enable ~/.nano_history for saving and reading search/replace strings.
# set historylog

## Use alternate keypad routines
# set keypad

## Allow multiple file buffers (using ^R inserts into separate buffer).
## You must have configured with --enable-multibuffer or --enable-extra
## for this to work.
##
## set multibuffer

## Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format
# set noconvert

## Don't follow symlinks when writing files
# set nofollow

## Don't display the help lists at the bottom of the screen
# set nohelp

## Don't wrap text at all
# set nowrap

## Set operating directory.  nano will not read or write files outside
## this directory and its subdirectories.  Also, the current directory
## is changed to here, so files are inserted from this dir.  A blank
## string means the operating directory feature is turned off.
##
# set operatingdir ""

## Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S)
# set preserve

## The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.
## This is an extended regular expression if your system supports them,
## otherwise a literal string.  Default:
# set quotestr "^([ 	]*[\|>:}#])+"
## if you have regexps, otherwise:
# set quotestr "> "
## You can get old nano quoted-justify behavior via:
# set quotestr "(> )+"

## Do extended regular expression searches by default 
# set regexp

## Use smooth scrolling as the default
# set smooth

## Use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.  This option
## does not properly have a default value.
##
# set speller "aspell -c"

## Allow nano to be suspended with ^Z
 set suspend

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0
 set tabsize 4

## Save automatically on exit, don't prompt
 set tempfile

## Disallow file modification, why would you want this in an rc file? ;)
# set view

## Color setup
## Format:
## syntax "short description" ["filename regex" ...]
## color foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
##
## Legal colors: white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, cyan.
## You may use the prefix "bright" to mean a stronger color highlight.
##
## To use multi-line regexes use the start="regex" end="regex" format.
##
## If your system supports transparency, not specifying a background
## color will use a transparent color.  If you don't want this, be sure
## to set the background color to black or white.
##
# syntax "c-file" "\.(c|h)$"
# color red "\<[A-Z_]{2,}\>" 
# color green "\<(float|char|int|void|static|const|struct)\>" 
# color brightyellow "\<(if|while|do|else|case|switch)\>"
# color brightcyan "^#( 	)*(define|include|ifn?def|endif|elif|else|if)" 
##
## You will in general want your comments and strings to come last,
## because syntax highlighting rules will be applied in the order they
## are read in.
##
# color brightyellow "<[^= 	]*>" ""(\\.|[^\"])*""
##
## This string is VERY resource intensive!!!
# color brightyellow start=""(\\.|[^\"])*\\( |	)*$" end="^(\\.|[^\"])*""
##
## And we want to have some nice comment highlighting too
# color brightblue "//.*"
# color brightblue start="/\*" end="\*/"



## Here is an example for your .nanorc
##
# syntax "nanorc" "[\.]*nanorc$"
# color white "^ *(set|unset).*$"
# color cyan "^ *(set|unset) (autoindent|backup|const|cut|fill|keypad|multibuffer|noconvert|nofollow|nohelp|nowrap|operatingdir|preserve|quotestr|regexp|smooth|speller|suspend|tabsize|tempfile|historylog|view)"
# color brightwhite "^ *syntax [^ ]*"
# color brightblue "^ *set\>" "^ *unset\>" "^ *syntax\>"
# color white "^ *color\>.*"
# color yellow "^ *color (bright)?(white|black|red|blue|green|yellow|magenta|cyan)\>"
# color magenta "^ *color\>"
# color green "^#.*$"

## Here is an example for Python.
##
syntax "python" "\.py$"
icolor brightblue "def [0-9A-Z_]+"
color brightcyan "\<(and|assert|break|class|continue|def|del|elif|else|except|exec|finally|for|from|global|if|import|in|is|lambda|map|not|or|pass|print|raise|return|try|while)\>"
color brightgreen "['][^']*[^\\][']" "[']{3}.*[^\\][']{3}"
color brightgreen "["][^"]*[^\\]["]" "["]{3}.*[^\\]["]{3}"
color brightgreen start=""""[^"]" end=""""" start="'''[^']" end="'''"
color brightred "#.*$"
