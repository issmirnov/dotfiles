- swap out fonts. make them bigger and cleaner
- convert status script to be a little more intelligent
- add divider indicator for the two screens (left side indicator)
- add docs about powerline fonts
- `brew cask install font-fontawesome` and embed fonts for icons

- set top bar to red as ell, when past bedtime. clock blends in too easily.
